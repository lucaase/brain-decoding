    "Welcome to the 2024 House Symposium of the Brain Institute! This short tutorial is designed to be part of the symposium, offering a comprehensive introduction to the intriguing realm of signal processing and oscillation analyses in neuroscience. Our focus will be on leveraging open-source tools to unravel the mysteries encoded in data recorded at the mesoscopic scale â€“ the Local Field Potential (LFP). The LFP serves as a dynamic window into the activity of a small, localized population of neurons proximate to the recording electrode.\n",
