# Decoding the Brain through Machine Learning

This repository contains materials for the workshop **"Decoding the Brain through Machine Learning"**, a hands-on introduction to using machine learning techniques for analyzing neural spike trains. Participants will learn how to apply dimensionality reduction, clustering, and classification to identify latent patterns within high-dimensional neural data.

## Workshop Overview

This workshop offers a blend of theory and practice in machine learning for neural data analysis. By the end, participants will have a foundational understanding of neural coding principles and practical skills in using Python-based tools to decode brain activity.

### Topics Covered

- **Introduction to Neural Coding and Signal Types**  
  Understand neural signal scales (macro, meso, micro), key electrophysiological data types (LFPs and spikes), and coding schemes such as rate coding and tuning curves.

- **High-Dimensional Neural Data Challenges**  
  Explore the complexities involved in handling large and complex datasets in neuroscience.

- **Dimensionality Reduction and Latent Patterns**  
  Learn methods like **PCA** and **UMAP** for dimensionality reduction and explore latent patterns with **CEBRA**.

- **Model Evaluation and Validation**  
  Understand metrics like accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1 score, and perform cross-validation techniques (K-fold, repeated, stratified) for model validation.
